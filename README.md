# BlogApplication


I developed a Blog Application using Spring Boot and JPA (Hibernate). This project allows users to create, update, and delete blog posts and comments. The main goal of this project was to understand how to build a backend application using Java and manage database interactions effectively.

Features:
User Management: Users can register and manage their profiles.
Post Management: Users can create, view, update, and delete blog posts.
Comment System: Users can add and delete comments on blog posts.
Database Integration: Used JPA with Hibernate to store and retrieve data.
Technologies Used:
Spring Boot for backend development
Hibernate (JPA) for database interaction
MySQL as the database
Spring Data JPA for easy CRUD operations
Learning Outcomes:
Understood how to create RESTful APIs using Spring Boot.
Learned how to handle database relationships like One-to-Many (User → Posts) and One-to-Many (Post → Comments).
Gained experience in handling exceptions and improving API responses.
Improved knowledge of CRUD operations and how to use repositories in Spring Boot.
This project helped me get hands-on experience in backend development. I also learned how to structure a Spring Boot project properly and manage relationships between entities.

I plan to enhance this project by adding user authentication and frontend integration in the future.
